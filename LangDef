Sections are defined using a: after the line
	The whole line is then taken as the section name
	The type of section (section/subsection/subsubsection/etc.) is the level of indent
	A section resets the level of the current bullet point 

Lines that are not sections are considered part of a bullet point or numbered list

Level of the list is determined by the indent relative to first list in the current section/subsection
