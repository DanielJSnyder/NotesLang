Driver -(char * dot_notesfile) -> Parser
Parser parses the file and stores its output internally
Driver calls the parser with the file to write to.


Possible Algorithms for parsing

1. Build the text file as a string in parser
	- Store the tags you've opened using a stack

2. Build it in a output stream (string stream) which you then can just output easier
	- Possibly more efficient because it prevents inserting more characters
